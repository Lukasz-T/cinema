# Movie Application

## Overview
This application is built using **Kotlin 1.9.25** and **Spring Boot 3.3.5**. It is designed to demonstrate API functionalities, testing, and integration with an in-memory H2 database for simplicity.

---

## Features
- **In-memory H2 Database** for data persistence during runtime.
- **OpenAPI 3** documentation for easy API exploration.
- **Basic Authentication** (to be implemented) for sensitive endpoints.
- APIs inspired by [this reference document](https://popshop.atlassian.net/wiki/external/Y2ZlNDViODdkYmY4NDg5OWE0MjgwNjdiMTFjMTZjYjg).
- Custom API to calculate the **average movie rating**.

---

## How to Access

### API Documentation
- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)
- API Docs (OpenAPI Spec): [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)

### Database Console
- H2 Console: [http://localhost:8080/h2_console](http://localhost:8080/h2_console)
    - **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
    - **Username**: `sa`
    - **Password**: `password`

Preloaded test data is available in all three database tables, accessible through the console.

---

## API Highlights

1. **Standard APIs**
    - Endpoints based on the provided API reference document.

2. **Custom API**
    - **Average Movie Rating**: Computes the average rating for a movie from the database.

3. **Planned Security Enhancements**
    - Basic Authentication for internal endpoints like adding showtimes and prices.
    - Not yet implemented due to time constraints.

---

## Testing

- Written using **JUnit 5**, **Mockito**, and **MockK**.
- Tests are categorized into three folders:
    - **Unit Tests**
    - **Integration Tests**
    - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**
- Note: The test suite does not cover 100% of the application and serves as a starting point for further improvement.

---

## Development Notes

- The project is configured for quick setup and ease of use with minimal dependencies.
- Future enhancements include expanding test coverage, implementing proper authentication, and optimizing API performance.
